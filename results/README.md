Directory to contain results for this project:

- `/results/dataframe`: dataframes used to generate plots
    - `./non_empty_bar_df`: dataframe used to generate bar plots and report statistical information for proportion of non-empty responses produced by each model on each test using both raw and adapted prompts (Figure 2A)
    - `./valid_bar_df`: dataframe used to generate bar plots and report statistical information for proportion of valid responses generated by each model on each test using only adapted prompts (Figure 2B)
    - `./accuracy_ci_df`: dataframe used to generate bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals and report statistical information for human and model performance on each test (Figure 3)
    - `./accuracy_scatter_df`: dataframe used to generate the scatter plot for every item and report statistical information for human and model performance on each test. Each dot represents either the mean proportion correct (GGR & VLAT)
or median normalized absolute error (HOLF) for a single test item (Figure 3)

- `/results/figures`: plots
    - `./final_figures`: final version of figures used in the paper
    - `./non_empty_bar_plots`: proportion of non-empty responses produced by each model on each test using both raw and adapted prompts in Figure 2A
    - `./valid_bar_plots`: proportion of valid responses generated by each model on each test using only adapted prompts in Figure 2B
    - `./accuracy_plots`: human and model performance on each test in Figure 3
