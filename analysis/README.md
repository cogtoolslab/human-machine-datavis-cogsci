Directory to contain analysis notebooks/scripts for this project.

## Files:
- `create_response_bar.py`: Used to find proportion of non-empty responses produced by each model on each test using both raw and adapted prompts and to generate Figure 1A
- `process_extracted_responses.py`: Used to find proportion of valid responses generated by each model on each test using only adapted prompts and to generate Figure 1B
- `create_accuracy_plot.py`: Used to find human and model performance on each test and generate Figure 3. Each dot represents either the mean proportion correct (GGR & VLAT) or median normalized absolute error (VLAT) for a single test item. Error bars represent bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.
- `create_pairwise_heatmap.py`: 
- `statistical_contrasts.ipynb`: Used to find statistical contrasts (difference of means) and confidence intervals in the subsection for pairwise comparisons between models and humans (subsection "How similar were responses generated by models and humans").
